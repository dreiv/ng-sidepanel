# SidePanel

`<app-sidepanel>`  is a panel that can be placed next to or above some primary content. It can be used for navigation, but can contain any content. 

The sidenav and its associated content live inside of an `<md-sidenav-container>`:
```html
<md-sidepanel-container>
  <md-sidepanel>
    <!-- sidenav content -->
  </md-sidepanel>

  <!-- primary content -->
</md-sidepanel-container>
